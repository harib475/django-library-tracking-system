# Implement a Celery task that runs daily to check for overdue book loans and sends email notifications to members.
# üìç Requirements:
# Update the Loan Model:
# Add a due_date field with a default value set to 14 days from the loan_date.
# Create a Celery Periodic Task:
# Define a task named check_overdue_loans that executes daily.
# The task should:
# Query all loans where is_returned is False and due_date is past.
# Send an email reminder to each member with overdue books.
# Apply Migrations:
# Make and apply the necessary database migrations to accommodate the updated model.
# Verify Task Execution:
# Test the Celery task to ensure it correctly identifies overdue loans and sends notifications.
#
#
# Configure Celery Beat Scheduler (optional):
# Only take on this task if you are familiar with Celery Beat, this task can be time consuming.
# Ensure that the check_overdue_loans task is scheduled to run daily using Celery Beat.
# Update docker-compose.yml:
# Add a celery-beat service to handle the periodic tasks.
